# java-haven
Just another JAVA repository

# Getting Started
This repository is for educational purpose. You'll find custom-made data-structure classes like those of 
linked-lists - unidirectional and bidirectional - etc. and various others - basically even I have no idea 
what I'm gonna do here.
As is the basic structure, you'll find the source codes under `src` folder and the usable class files under `out` folder.<br>
**So, why not clone this repository and already start using the classes?**

# Contributing
