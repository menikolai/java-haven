# Linked Lists
These classes are cyclic. As the classnames suggest, they support unidirectional or bidirectional flow of control. You'll find detailed documentation in the `java-haven/custom-data-structures/doc` folder regarding the usage of the class' methods.
They are only for educational purposes and I make no claim as to their efficiency. But one thing's for sure - they provide greater flexibility - than the definitions allow. You can add and remove elements from the middle of the list.
## Drawbacks ##
Since these classes still do not implement the interfaces - Serializable, Cloneable, Iterable<E>, Collection<E>, Deque<E>, List<E>, Queue<E> - they might not prove as handy. For example, they cannot be cloned(this feature will be added in a next release). Also, they cannot be run on the enhanced for loops.
